                <ol>
                    <li>View the source code for THIS page that you are currently reading (ltp_lesson2.html) and notice
                        the added &lt;script&gt; line near the bottom of the document. This loads the jQuery library
                        which we have located in our resources folder and allows us to use it.

                    </li>
                    <li>Hit F12 to open the developer tools menu.</li>
                    <li>Go to the "Console" tab.</li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Introducing jQuery:</h3>
                        Type the following into the console:<br/>
                        <code><xmp class="prettyprint">$('#testing ol').append('<li>Added with jQuery!</li>');</xmp></code><br/>
                        
                        <div class="explanation">
                            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
                            <p>
                            The dollar sign followed by parenthesis $() is a special notation mostly used by jQuery
                            for selecting DOM elements. $('#testing') would tell jQuery to grab the element where id="testing".
<xmp class="prettyprint"><section id="testing">
    ...
</section>
</xmp>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            $('#testing ol') tells jQuery to grab any &lt;ol&gt; elements that are children of #testing.
                            Notice that in this case, &lt;ol&gt; is not a direct child of &lt;section id="testing"&gt;,
                            but rather a grandchild, with the direct parent being &lt;span&gt;.
<xmp class="prettyprint"><section id="testing">   
    <div id="bar"></div>
    <span class="wrap">
        <h2>Test Result Area:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
    </span>
</section></xmp>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            If we had wanted to
                            limit the search to direct children only (which would have returned zero results as &lt;span&gt; and
                                &lt;div id="bar"&gt; are the only
                            direct children) we could have written it this way: $('#testing > ol')
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To learn more about jQuery selectors, I highly recommend looking at the following reference:
                                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp</a>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Observe that this single jQuery powered line of code accomplished the same task as writing 4 lines of code using
                        the native javascript that we used in the previous lesson!

<xmp class="prettyprint">// Create an <li> node
var liNode = document.createElement("LI");
    
// Create a text node
var textNode = document.createTextNode("I ROCK!");
    
// Attach the text to the LI node to create the equivalent of <li>TEXT</li>
liNode.appendChild(textNode);
    
// Attach the new list item to the <ul> unordered list.
document.getElementById('testing').children[1].children[1].appendChild(liNode);
</xmp>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>jQuery vs. Native Javascript:</h3>
                        Alright, now lest I get angry hate mail from Javascript experts, I need to clarify that there IS an easier
                        way to do what we did using native Javascript. The reason I had you do it the hard way is to gain an understanding
                        of what's going on under the surface with nodes, and to gain experience traversing the DOM tree. You can verify
                        that the following easier native Javascript also works:
                        <xmp class="prettyprint">document.querySelector('#testing ol').innerHTML += '<li>I Really Rock!</li>';</xmp>
                        Be aware it doesn't use the same selector syntax as jQuery, but instead uses CSS selectors (reference 
                        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">here</a>).
                        
                        <p>
                            HOWEVER, this native code is still not as powerful as what jQuery provides us. Execute the following two lines of
                            code and observe the result when we try to modify multiple list items at once:<br>
                            jQuery:
                            <code class="prettyprint">$('#testing li').text('jQuery rocks!');</code>
                            Native Javascript:
                            <code class="prettyprint">document.querySelector('#testing li').textContent = 'Javascript Rocks!'</code>
                            You should notice that the native code only changes the first item. This is because to do what we did with jQuery
                            and change all the list items, we'd have to use "querySelectorAll" and then run a loop over all the nodes
                            it returns. Suffice to say, this is more hassle! From here on out we'll stick with jQuery for ease of use and 
                            cross browser compatibility.

            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
            <h3>Libraries:</h3>
            <p>
                Native (or vanilla) Javascript is generally referred to as code you can run without any external support, as it's a built-in
                part of the programming language. The 4 lines of code we ran in Lesson #1 were an example of native Javascript
                code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Libaries on the other hand, are pre-packaged code that you have to include in your project in order to make
                use of them. jQuery is an example of one such library, and is written by many (probably 100+) developers
                that have contributed to it over the years. The reason jQuery was made is to simplify and improve the way
                certain tasks are accomplished - as you saw in this lesson.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning how to use Libraries will be super important in your life as a developer! Technically, you don't
                NEED them - you could just implement whatever you want using native code and working through the issues that
                come up yourself - but doing so would be like reinventing the wheel. If somebody's already written the code
                to accomplish what you're trying to do, and they've licensed the code to be used by others, might as well
                save some time and just use/tweak what's already been written.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding jQuery, there's TONS of stuff you can do with it, and we're not going to cover it in-depth here, but
                you can Google something like "cool jQuery effects" to learn more. We will however be using some additional
                jQuery functionality in future lessons - so stay tuned.
            </p>
            
            <h3>DOM Manipulation:</h3>
            <p>
                Alright, so you've now had two lessons that involved adding an item to a list. What you may not realize, is 
                that modifying lists is one of the MOST COMMON uses for javascript in modern web applications! I'll give you
                three examples from Facebook:
                <ul>
                    <li>User Search - When you start typing a name in the box at the top of Facebook, you'll see a drop down
                    list of matching names before you even finish typing. This is using what you've just learned!!! As you
                    start typing, Facebook is using javascript to send the partial name to the web server, and that server is
                    responding with a list of possible matches. Javascript is then used to load those possible matching names
                    into the drop down list you see.</li>
                    <li>Chat - When you chat with someone over Facebook using one of those little chat windows at the bottom
                    of the screen, what you're actually seeing is a list of messages between people. When a new message is
                    received, javascript is used to update the chat window with the new message.</li>
                    <li>Infinite Scrolling - You know how you can just keep scrolling down forever in Facebook or Twitter and
                    never have to hit a "next page" button? This pageless "infinite scrolling" effect is accomplished by
                    making requests to the back-end web servers for more posts as you scroll, and then using javascript
                    to load them into the bottom of your post list - so you never hit the end.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="next">
            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <p>
                So far we've used simple javascript statements to manipulate the DOM, which is cool, but it's time to step
                up our game. Next we'll be learning about Functions, which will be a HUGE step forwards in your goal of
                learning to be a software developer.
