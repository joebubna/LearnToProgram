            <h2>Exercise:</h2>
            <p>We have two text boxes setup, one for entering your First name, and one for entering your Last name.
            First, we are going to make it so the names entered in those boxes get combined into a Full name. Then we'll
            see a really simple example of how we can use a Function to improve our code.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A new javascript file has been included on this page in addition to jQuery! Open
                        up "lesson3.js" from the "resources/student/" folder in your text editor - this is where you will be writing your
                        code now instead of using the Console. All the code you are instructed to write for this lesson
                        should be saved into that .js file. <br><br>
                        Below is how your custom javascript file gets included on the web page.
<xmp class="prettyprint"><body>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="resources/jQuery-2.1.4.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="resources/student/lesson3.js"></script>
</body></xmp>
                        
                        <div class="hl">
                        <h3>IMPORTANT!!!</h3>
                        Just because you won't be writing your code in the console anymore DOES NOT mean you should stop opening it.
                        When you run into errors that cause your code to not work, the console will usually tell you where to look
                        for the error!!! This is SUPER useful as you WILL make typos, even when following this guide. There's also
                        ways you can walk through your code's execution step-by-step using the "sources" tab in Chrome or "debugger" tab in 
                        Microsoft Edge, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.
                        </div>
                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before we get started with our Javascript code, take a look at the HTML we will be working with from this
                        lesson's Testing Area:
<xmp class="prettyprint"><div>First Name: <input type="text" id="firstName"></div>
<div>Last Name: <input type="text" id="lastName"></div>
<hr>
<div>Fullname = <span id="fullName"></span></div></xmp>                       
                    </li>
                    <li>First, we want to setup our Javascript events that will cause our code to get executed. Events are
                        things such as clicking something on the web page, moving the mouse over an area of the web page, pressing
                        a key on the keyboard, etc. Since we want to "do something" when a user types into either the first or
                        last name textboxes, we will use an event called "oninput".<br><br>
                        
                        Recall that in the last lesson we used the jQuery "append" function to modify the DOM like so:
                        <code class="prettyprint"><xmp>$('#testing ol').append('<li>I ROCK!</li>');</xmp></code><br>
                        
                        To attach an event to a DOM item or items, we will use a similar format like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">$('#firstName').on('input', function() {
    ... <span class="nocode">code to execute when event triggers</span> ...
});</pre>                        
                        Type the above code into your lesson3.js file, then we'll fill in the center part later. See below for an explanation.
                        
                        <div class="explanation">
                            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    First, we use a jQuery selector - <span class="hl">$('#firstName')</span> - to select the DOM element we
                                    want to attach an event to.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Second, we are calling the "on" function with the <span class="hl">.on()</span> code. This function creates
                                    the event attachment, but we have to pass it additional information which in programming lingo are called
                                    "parameters."<br><br>
                                    
                                    The parameters it requires from us are:<br><br>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>The events we want to trigger our code on.</li>
                                            <li>The code we want to execute when a trigger happens, which will be a function.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    <span class="note">
                                        Note: The actual values being passed into a function with parameters are referred
                                        to as the "arguments." If you have a function that calculates a person's age when given their birth year, 
                                        "birthYear" would be its parameter and "1985" might be the argument you pass it.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Okay, now for the confusing part... the parameters between the "on" parenthesis. So as we just mentioned,
                                    there's two arguments being passed. so it might be easy to understand to look at it this way:
                                    <code>$('#firstName').on(<span class="hl">parameter1</span>, <span class="hl">parameter2</span>);</code>
                                    WHERE
                                    <code>parameter1 = 'input'</code>
                                    AND
<code>
<xmp>parameter2 = function() {
    ... code to execute ...
}
</xmp>                        
</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Passing in the string "input" as the first parameter tells the function that the event we want to bind
                                    to this DOM element is the oninput event. It's technically possible to pass multiple events seperated by
                                    a space (e.g. 'input mouseover click keyup') but we don't need to do that for this example.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The second parameter is the doozey, and that's because we're passing in a whole function that we want to
                                    execute when the event gets triggered. This is called an <span class="hl">anonymous function</span>. 
                                    Don't worry if it confuses you right now, we'll start digging into functions in a bit. Hang in there!! :)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Alright, let's fill in the code we want to execute when the event triggers. It's a pretty simple two lines, and you
                        can probably figure out what it does right away. Add the following two lines to your code:
<xmp class="prettyprint">var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
$('#fullName').text(fullname);
</xmp>
                        
                        <p>
                            We're constructing the person's full name by taking the text entered into the firstName box, adding a
                            space, then adding ("concatonating" is technical term) the text in the lastName box. After we got
                            the fullname, we then use jQuery's amazing simplicity to update the text in our fullName field on the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>Go ahead and reload this page after you've added the above to your lesson3.js file, then try typing something
                        in the First Name box. Your code in your lesson3.js file should look like the below at this point:</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint">$('#firstName').on('input', function() {
    var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
    $('#fullName').text(fullname);
});                    
</xmp>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Let's do the same thing for the lastName box. Add the following to your file:
<xmp class="prettyprint">$('#lastName').on('input', function() {
    var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
    $('#fullName').text(fullname);
});                    
</xmp>                        
                        Now reload the page and test the results again. If you didn't make any typos, you should see
                        the "Fullname" updating instantly when you start typing in either the first or last name boxes.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        One thing you may have noticed, is that our code is almost identical for both the firstName and lastName
                        pieces. In-fact, the code we are executing when our events trigger is EXACTLY IDENTICAL!!!
<pre>
$('#firstName').on('input', function() {
    <span class="hl">var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
    $('#fullName').text(fullname);</span>
});

$('#lastName').on('input', function() {
    <span class="hl">var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
    $('#fullName').text(fullname);</span>
});                    
</pre>                         
                        This is a PERFECT opportunity to pull that code out, and place it into a function. Functions serve
                        as reusable blocks of code that help you keep your code clean and organized - reducing repitition
                        by allowing you to execute it multiple times without writing it out each time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Below the code you've already written, add the following:
<pre class="prettyprint">
function outputName() {
    var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
    $('#fullName').text(fullname);
}
</pre>
                        <p>
                            As you can see, it's pretty easy. You just declare that you're writing a function, give the function a name,
                            declare any parameters you require between parenthesis (leave empty if no data is needed), and then finally
                            write a block of code you want to execute by placing it between brackets {}.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Now that we have our code added to a function, go back and edit what we wrote earlier, replacing the repetitive
                        code with calls to our function. The end result of your code for this project should look like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
$('#firstName').on('input', function() {
    outputName();
});

$('#lastName').on('input', function() {
    outputName();
});


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Function(s)
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

function outputName() {
    var fullname = $('#firstName').val() + ' ' + $('#lastName').val();
    $('#fullName').text(fullname);
}
</pre>              
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        One quick last note: Now that we moved our repetitive code to the outputName function and all that's left
                        to do when the event triggers is calling outputName() and nothing
                        else, we could eliminate the anonymous function and just call outputName directly like so:
<pre class="prettyprint">
$('#firstName').on('input', outputName);
$('#lastName').on('input', outputName);
</pre>                        
                    
                    
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
            </span>

            <p>
                Alright, you made it! That was a doozy of a lesson despite the simplicity of the end result. Things will slowly get
                easier from here on out though; as you learn more of the programming fundamentals, we'll be able to focus less
                on small details and more on the larger concepts of building cool stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                By completing this lesson you should now have a basic understanding of using jQuery to bind Javascript events to 
                DOM elements, writing a simple function to reduce code repetition, and even some understanding of passing
                functions as a parameter for another function! Phew!
