                        <h3>Test #1:</h3>
                        The first thing you need to know before we dig into this lesson is that functions can be written as what's called 
                        Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions. Unlike normal functions which are defined somewhere in your code, and
                        then invoked somewhere else by using the format "functionName()", these are functions that are immediately executed.
                        
                        <p>
                            IIFE's use the format "(...define function between parenthesis...)()" which as you can see is very similar to how you'd
                            normally call a function, only instead of naming a function defined somewhere else, you're defining some function
                            between parenthesis and then immediately invoking it afterwards via "()". You'll see several examples of this shortly, 
                            I just wanted to explain it beforehand so you aren't confused.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                            The next thing I should probably explain upfront is that functions can be nested inside each other.
                            It's very similar to how HTML elements can be nested. In the following example, &lt;div&gt; is a child of &lt;section&gt;
                            and &lt;span&gt; is a direct child of &lt;div&gt; and a grandchild of &lt;section&gt;.
                        </p>
                        
<xmp class="prettyprint"><section>
    <div>
        <span>Hello World</span>
    </div>
</section>
</xmp>
                        
                        <p>
                            Just like the nesting in the HTML example above, in the Javascript example below you'll see several IIFEs nested 
                            inside each other. This is significant because in Javascript nested functions inherit the variables of their
                            parents. Take a look at the code below and see if you can guess what the value of "x" will be:
                        </p>
                
                        
<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #1
////////////////////////////////////////
var x = 0;

(function level1() {
    x = 1; 
    (function level2() {
        x = 2;      
        (function level3() {
            x += 3;
        })();       
    })();   
})();

(function b() {
    x += 2;
})();

$('#ex1_varX').text(x);
</xmp>
                        <p>
                            If you input the above code into your js file and reload the page, you'll see that the value of "x" 
                            for this first test is equal to 7. In the "global" scope, we set the value of x=0, then in the first
                            function we change x's value to 1, then in the 2nd function we set x=2. In the 3rd function we increase
                            the value of x by 3 bringing it's value to 5, and then in function "b" at the end we increase its value
                            by another 2 for a total of 7.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The important thing to see is that although we first declare x in the 
                            <span class="hl">global scope (I.E. outside of any function)</span>,
                            each of the functions inherit access to it and can change x's value.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h3>Test #2:</h3>
                        Take a look at the following code. Can you guess the value of x at the various points? Add this to your file
                        below the first example to find out.
                        
<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #2
////////////////////////////////////////
var x = 0;
(function outer() {
    var x = 20;   
    (function () {
        x += 10;
    })();    
    $('#ex2_varX1').text(x); // POINT #1  
})();

$('#ex2_varX3').text(x); // POINT #2                   
</xmp>
                    
                        <p>
                            Did you guess right? Refresh the page after adding that code and check.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main thing to notice that's different in this example is the use of the "var" keyword
                            in front of x in the first function. THIS IS IMPORTANT! That "var x = 20" statement declares a local variable
                            named "x" that overrides the global x's value within that function and all its decendents. So that inner function
                            inherits the value of x=20 from its parent rather than the global (grandparent level) value of x=0. That is
                            why the value of x at Point #1 is 30. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Point #2 the thing to notice is that the modifications we made to x within the functions only affect their
                            local value and do NOT affect the exterior (global) value of variable x. Once Outer() is done executing, any local 
                            variables it declared (such as its version of x) are destroyed.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h3>Test #3:</h3>
                        How about this example - can you guess the value of "y"? Add this to your code:

<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #3
////////////////////////////////////////
var x = 2;
(function () {
    y = x; 
})();      
$('#ex3_varY').text(y);
</xmp>
                    
                        <p>
                            As you can see, if you guessed "2" as the value of y, you are correct. Now you might be be confused by this
                            as we just got finished explaining that after a function is finished executing, all its local variables are destroyed.
                            That being the case, how does y have a value since it was first declared inside the function and we're not using
                            it until after the function is done??? The answer in this case is the lack of a "var" keyword in front of y.
                            Because we left the "var" keyword off, the declaration "y = x" makes "y" a global variable!
                        </p>
                        
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h3>Test #4:</h3>
                        Can you correctly say which values x and y will have?
                        
<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #4
////////////////////////////////////////
var x = 0;
var y = 15;
mine();
$('#ex4_varX').text(x);
$('#ex4_varY').text(y);
    
function mine() {
    x += 9;
    var y = 7;
}                      
</xmp>
                        <p>
                            The main difference here is we're not using an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression, but rather just a normal
                            function and function call. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h3>Test #5: Parameters</h3>
                        <p>
                            Next up, parameters! If you recall the lesson on functions, "parameters" are the variables you pass along to functions.
                            They look like this:
                        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    
    }
</pre>
                        <p>
                            There's a couple important things to know about how passing arguments into function parameters works. 
                            Add the following to your code and observe the result:
                        </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #5
////////////////////////////////////////
myVar = 22;
test( myVar );
$('#ex5').append( myVar );

function test(item) {
    item = 5;
    $('#ex5').html(item + '<br>');
}                        
</xmp>
                        <p>
                            Here we define a variable and assign a numerical value of 22 to it, after which we invoke our "test" function and pass
                            our variable in as the argument. Inside test(), the parameter variable "item" will have the same value as "myVar".
                            We then assign a new value to our parameter and output this new value to our testing results.
                            Then after test() is done, we then add the current value of "myVar" to our testing area below the previous output
                            from the function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What we want to know is: "Will
                            changing the value of 'item' within the function also change the value of 'myVar' which was passed in as its value?"
                            You should see in our testing results that the answer to this for now is "no". When passing in primitive data types
                            such as a number or a string, you pass these variables in BY VALUE, meaning "item" has the same value as "myVar" but
                            it's a distinctly different variable. As such, changing "item" in this scenario does not change the value of "myVar".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now modify the code you wrote above to match what's below and then reload the page:
                        </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #5
////////////////////////////////////////
myVar = [1,2,3];
test( myVar );
$('#ex5').append( myVar.toString() );

function test(item) {
    item[0] = 5;
    $('#ex5').html(item.toString() + '<br>');
}                        
</xmp>
                        <p>
                            What we've done is change our "myVar" from a simple number to now being an array of numbers. We pass it in to our 
                            test() function just like before, and then in the function we attempt to change the first value in the array.
                            What you'll notice about the results of this experiement is that unlike before, now changes to "item" are also
                            affecting "myVar"! This is because non-primitive data types such as arrays and objects are passed into functions
                            BY REFERENCE. Under this scenario "item" is not a copy of "myVar" with the same value, but rather is a direct link
                            to the memory location of myVar's data. So any changes made to the data inside the function will also affect
                            the data outside the function too. This is a simple but important thing to remember!
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            Note: The ".toString" method we are calling on the array just converts the array into a string that we can output
                            to our web page.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Test #6: Closures</h3>
                        Switching gears just a little bit, there's an important concept in Javascript that's related to what we've been talking
                        about called "closures." Remember how I stated earlier that local variables are destroyed after a function is finished
                        executing? Also how I stated that a function has access to the variables of its ancestors? Closures allow us to bypass
                        the destruction of variables we might want to hold onto by storing them in a parent function.
                        
                        <p>
                            For example, let's say we want to make a counter. Our counter starts at a value of 0, and we have a function
                            called increment() that increases the value by 1 each time it's called. Now we could store our "count" variable
                            in the global scope to protect it from getting destroyed after increment() is done executing, but that adds clutter,
                            opens the possibility that we might accidently change our counter elsewere in the code, and makes it so we'd have to 
                            add count1, count2, count3, etc, if we wanted more than one counter. NO BUENO.
                        </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint">// Bad attempt at counter
var counter1 = 0;
var counter2 = 0;
increment1 = function() {
    counter1 += 1;
}
increment2 = function() {
    counter2 += 1;
}
increment1() // counter1 now equals 1, etc.
</xmp>
                        <p>
                            A better way is to use the concept of a closure. A closure is a function defined inside a parent function that has access
                            to variables in that parent. This works to preserve our variables from getting destroyed because in Javascript functions
                            remember the context in which they were defined, so even after they finish executing, the data in their parent will
                            be preserved so it's available if we call the child function again. I realize that's a mouthful, but hang in there and
                            take a look at the example below:
                        </p>
                        
<xmp class="prettyprint">////////////////////////////////////////
// Example #6
////////////////////////////////////////
function Counter1() {
    var count = 0;
    this.increment = function() {
        count += 1;
    }
    this.decrement = function() {
        count -= 1;   
    }
    this.getValue = function() {
        return count;   
    }
}

</xmp>                      
                        <p>
                            In the above example, increment(), decrement(), and getValue(), are all closures because they are inner functions
                            that have access to their parent's "count" variable. This allows us to keep track of count's value between
                            function calls. In this example we create two separate counters, do some increment/decrement calls on them,
                            and then output the results to our testing area. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To get the value of our counters we are calling their getValue()
                            method, but then after that we try to access the "count" varible in each counter directly by calling "c1.count", etc.
                            You should see a result value of "undefined" for our attempt at accessing the count variable directly. This is because
                            although child functions inherit access to the variable scope of their parent, the same does not work in reverse. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You
                            cannot normally access local variables defined in a child function from the parent's scope. "count" is defined
                            as a variable within the Counter1 function, so we CANNOT access that varible from the global scope (outside of any 
                            function). This provides us with what's known in the programming world as Private Variables. To read that private
                            variable we either have to use a closure method like getValue() that exposes the variable to us, or we expose it 
                            directly by defining it as "this.count = 0;".

                            <h3>Important Definition: Object Constructor</h3>
                            <p>
                                I want to pause our discussion on Closures to quickly interject an important definition. In the above counter example
                                the Counter1 function is what's called an "<span class="hl">Object Constructor</span>" in Javascript. 
                                An Object Constructor is a function
                                specifically designed to make objects (such as our counters). By convention constructors have their first
                                letter capitalized to designate them as a constructor so they don't get confused with a regular function.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the closure functions in our example (increment, decrement, getValue) are not normally called
                                Closures or Functions when included as part of an object constructor like you see above.
                                Programmers will commonly refer to these functions that are members of objects as "<span class="hl">Methods</span>".
                                So to recap that, functions designed to create objects are capitalized and called Object Constructors, and the
                                closure functions belonging to a constructor function are called Methods. Just remember that.

                            Alright, so you hopefully have a basic understanding of what a closure is now and why it might be useful. As the 
                            old saying goes though - there's multiple ways to skin a cat - and Javascript is no exception. If you wish to 
                            learn more about additional closure formats you might see other programmers use and an alternative called prototypes,

function Counter1() {

    }
    this.decrement = function() {

    this.getValue = function() {

    };
}

function Counter3() {
    this._count = 0;   
}
Counter3.prototype.increment = function () {
    this._count += 1;  
};
Counter3.prototype.decrement = function () {
    this._count -= 1;   
}
Counter3.prototype.getValue = function () {
    return this._count;   
}

// Test

c2.increment();
c3.increment();

$('#ex6_counter').html(
    'Counter #1 = ' + c1.getValue() + ', Variable = ' + c1.count + '<br>' +
    'Counter #2 = ' + c2.getValue() + ', Variable = ' + c2.count + '<br>' + 
    'Counter #3 = ' + c3.getValue() + ', Variable = ' + c3._count + '<br>'
);
                        
</xmp>
                        <p>
                            In addition to our first counter which we've already used, we added two new versions of counter, namely
                            counter2 and Counter3. Counter1 we implemented as an object constructor where we create new instances of
                            it by using the "new" keyword. Counter3 is also a constructor and as such we capitalize the
                            first letter of both by convention. counter2 is just a fancy function for using closures, and so does not
                            have its letter capitalized.           
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            counter2 should look pretty straight forward to you. The only tricky part being the return statement. Unlike
                            our constructor functions that expose data members (variables and methods) via the "this" keyword, counter2
                            returns an object that exposes access to the internal functions. Recall that data objects are composed of 
                            "property : value" pairs in Javascript. In this case the "value" returned is not a number or string like
                            you'd normally expect, but rather a reference to the closure functions and the "property" is being named
                            the same as the function for convenience's sake. If you still don't quite get it, examine the object
                            below for another example and then go back and look at counter2 again:
                        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function exampleFunctionOfSuperAwesomeness() {
    return 42;
}

var myObject = {
    myAge : 30,
    myFunction : exampleFunctionOfSuperAwesomeness
};

myObject.myAge; // Returns 30
myObject.myFunction(); // Returns 42
</pre>
                        <p>
                            Counter3 is very similar to Counter1, but instead implements it's methods via prototype definitions
                            NOT closures.
                            In Counter1 each object created from it has its own versions of increment, decrement, and getValue (even 
                            if they are identical). This uses some extra computer resources. 
                            By defining the methods as prototypes, this means all objects created from
                            Counter3 by default share the same methods. In older browsers the use of prototypes is significantly faster
                            than using closures, although modern browsers are optimized such that the differences are minimal.
                            The main thing to notice here is that "this._count" is NOT a private variable! You can't use private variables
                            with prototypes. Instead, programmers by convention use an underscore to denote variables they want to treat
                            like private ones.
                        </p>

                            I realize this whole example 6 section probably seems very abstract, and don't worry if you still have some 
                            confusion. As long as you understand what was happening in Counter1 and that we can use closures to preserve
                            variable values between function calls, you're golden! The additional examples were just to expose you to 
                            some other ways of doing things so you aren't clueless if you run into code written by other programmers
                            that use one of those alternate formats.
