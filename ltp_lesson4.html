                    <li>Open up "lesson4.js" from the "resources/student/" folder in your text editor. All the code you are instructed to write for this lesson
                        should be saved into that .js file.

                        <h3>If / Else Statements</h3>
                        First off, let's play with some IF/ELSE statements. They follow a very simple format and are one of the major building
                        blocks in controlling the computer and making your app do useful things. The format is basically this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
if (condition is true) {
    ... execute code ...
}
else {
    ... execute some other code ...
}
</pre>
                        <span class="note">Note: The "else" part is optional. You can leave it out if you don't need it.</span>
                        <p>
                        Let's pretend we have four siblings who each plan to spend a different amount on a Christmas gift for their Mom,
                        and our computer can somehow read their minds. We want our app to give us the name of the sibling who plans to spend the most.
                        Add all the following to your lesson4.js file. You can leave out the comments if you understand the logic without them.
                        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Data
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Amount the children intend to spend on Mom's Christmas gift in dollars.
var child = {
    matt : 45,
    john : 20,
    susan : 120
};

// The variable we'll hold the result string in.
var result;

////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// If / Else Test #1
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if (child.matt > child.john) {
    // Matt intends to spend more than John. 
    //Let's test if he will spend more than Susan.
    
    if (child.matt > child.susan) {
        // Matt intends to spend more than both John and Susan. 
        // Matt wins.
        result = 'Matt intends to spend the most.';
    }
    else {
        // Matt intends to spend more than John, but not more than Susan. 
        // Susan wins.
        result = 'Susan intends to spend the most.';
    }
}
else {
    // John intends to spend more than Matt. 
    // Let's test if he will spend more than Susan.
    
    if (child.john > child.susan) {
        // John intends to spend more than both Matt and Susan. 
        // John Wins. 
        result = 'John intends to spend the most.';
    }
    else {
        // John intends to spend more than Matt, but not more than Susan. 
        // Susan wins.
        result = 'Susan intends to spend the most.';
    }
}

// Update our Test Results area with result.
$('#ifElse1').html( result );
</pre>
                        If you have that code added to your file and reload the page, you should see the correct result show up for if/else test #1.
                        Feel free to change the values each child intends to spend, and verify that the result correctly changes to match.
                        
                        <p>
                            Probably the most important thing to notice is that you can nest if/else statments inside each other. If the
                            first IF statement evaluates to true, then we know Matt intends to spend more than John and can eliminate John
                            as a canidate for highest spender. At that point we know either Matt or Susan intend to spend the most and can test
                            them against each other to determine the final answer.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let's repeat the same Christmas gift spending test we did above, but this time I want to show you another way to do the same
                        thing. Add the following to your file below our first test:
                        
<pre class="prettyprint">
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// If / Else Test #2
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if (child.matt > child.john) {
    // So we know at this point Matt will outspend John.
    // Now we need to test if he'll outspend Susan.
    if (child.matt > child.susan)
        result = 'Matt intends to spend the most.';
    else 
        result = 'Susan intends to spend the most.';
}
else if (child.john > child.susan) {
    // The first "IF" test failed, so we know John plans to spend 
    // more than Matt. If the above "else if" condition is true, 
    // then John also intends to outspend Susan. Thus:
    result = 'John intends to spend the most.';
}
else {
    // If we got to here, then we know the first "IF" failed,
    // Thus John intends to outspend Matt.
    // Also the "else if" failed, so we know
    // Susan intends to outspend John. Thus:
    result = 'Susan intends to spend the most.';  
}

// Update our Test Results area with result.
$('#ifElse2').html( result );
</pre>
                    
                        Reload the page and verify that this 2nd test gives the same result as the first. The new "else if" statement
                        only gets tested if the first IF statement fails its condition. Using Else-Ifs allows us to "unroll" embedded 
                        if/else statements which can sometimes help to keep code from getting too complex with multiple embedded blocks.
                        See below for an example of what I'm talking about.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ok, let's say we want to find the kid that will spend the most using only if/else statements, but we don't
                        want ANY embedded if/elses. Can we do it? The answer is "yes!" Add the following to your code below test #2:
                        
<pre class="prettyprint">
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// If / Else Test #3
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if (child.matt > child.john && child.matt > child.susan) {
    result = 'Matt intends to spend the most.';
}
else if (child.john > child.susan && child.john > child.matt) {
    result = 'John intends to spend the most.';
}
else {
    result = 'Susan intends to spend the most.';  
}

// Update our Test Results area with result.
$('#ifElse3').html( result );
</pre>
                    
                        The "&&" operator allows you to connect different conditions and require them both to be true. So 
                        "child.matt > child.john && child.matt > child.susan" only passes if Matt's number is larger than
                        BOTH John and Susan. 
                        
                        <p>Note: If you were in a situation where you had code you wanted executed if
                        EITHER of two statements were true, you could use the "||" operator like so:
                        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
if (condition1 || condition2) {
    // This code will execute if EITHER of the conditions above are true ...
}
</pre>
                        Another commonly used operator is negation which is represented by an exclamation point "!".
                        Anything preceeded by an exclamation is negated such that !True == False and True == !False.
                        When using the negation operator it is often helpful to use extra parentheses to keep track
                        of what you are negating.
<pre class="prettyprint">
// All 3 of the statements below are equal.
if (  10 > 5     ); // TRUE
if (  !(10 < 5)  ); // NOT(FALSE) == TRUE
if (  !(5 > 10)  ); // NOT(FALSE) == TRUE 
</pre>
                        
                        <h3>Final Thought on If/Else Tests:</h3>
                        <p>It's worth noting that we aren't taking into account situations where there's a tie for
                        biggest spender. Do you think you could modify the code to take ties into account? It's worth
                        thinking about, but probably not doing as this example is impractical to begin with.</p>
                        <p>
                        Imagine if you were a business owner and you wanted to
                        know which of your 3000 customers in the last month placed the biggest order... you can probably
                        see that solving a question like that through if/else statements would be crazy.</p>
                        
                        <p>In extremely large data situations you'll actually want to use a sorting algorithm, but I'll
                        show you how to use loops to obtain an answer in small to medium sized data sets in the steps below.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>For/In Loop</h3>
                        Time for our first loop! We'll use javascript's For/In loop to do our sibling spending test a little easier.
                        Add the following to your code:
                        
 <xmp class="prettyprint">
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// For/In Loop
////////////////////////////////////////////////////

var name;
var biggestValue = 0;
var biggestSpender;
result = '';

for (name in child) {
    
    result += name + ' intends to spend ' + child[name] + '<br>';
    
    if (child[name] == biggestValue)
        biggestSpender += ' & ' + name;
     
    else if (child[name] > biggestValue) {
        biggestSpender  = name;
        biggestValue    = child[name];
    }
}
result += 'The sibling(s) that intends to spend the most is ' +
            biggestSpender;

$('#forInLoop').html( result );
 </xmp>                       
                        <div class="explanation">
                            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
                            For/In loops allow you to iterate over an object's attributes. In this case, our "child" object's
                            attributes are the names of the three kids, and each attribute's associated value is the money
                            they intend to spend. Remember our Child object we are using looks like this:
 
<pre class="prettyprint">
var child = {
    matt : 45,
    john : 20,
    susan : 120
};
</pre>
                            On the first iteration of the "for (name in child)" loop, name will be equal to "matt", and the value
                            of "child[name]" is the same as saying "child[matt]" which will return the value associated with the 
                            attribute matt... in this case 45. The 2nd iteration of the loop, name will equal "john", and child[name]
                            will return 20, etc.
                            
                            <p>
                                It's worth noting that the "name" in "for (name in child)" is just an arbitrary variable that best 
                                describes our object for this example. If we wanted we could say "for (x in child)" and then reference
                                the value associated with each attribute using "child[x]", but that's just not as naturally descriptive
                                of what we're doing. It's always best to try and use descriptive variable names that help a reader 
                                understand what you're doing rather than generic "X" or the like.
                            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var name;
var biggestValue = 0;
var biggestSpender;
result = '';
</pre>
                            <p>
                                So taking a step back, let's talk about what we're doing at the top in our variable declaration area.
                                "name" is the variable name we'll be iterating on in our loop, so we just declare it. Don't worry about
                                understanding why we do that just yet, we'll go more into
                                the "why" behind variable declarations in the next lesson when we talk about scope.
                                Next we're declaring and setting a variable "biggestValue" to zero which we'll use to hold the largest value
                                we find while running through our loop. Lastly, we're declaring a variable "biggestSpender" which we'll use
                                to hold the name(s) of the kid who plans to spend the most and we're resetting "result" which we've been using
                                in previous tests back to an empty string.
                            </p>
                            
<xmp class="prettyprint">result += name + ' intends to spend ' + child[name] + '<br>';</xmp>                            
                            <p>
                                The thing I should probably explain about this statement is that the += operator appends whatever value
                                follows to whatever is already existing in "result". I.E. If result had a value of "hello", and then I said
                                <code>result += ' world';</code>
                                Result would then hold a value of "hello world". Note: If result held a number, let's say 2, and I said "result += 3", 
                                result would then hold a value of 5.
                            </p>
                            
<pre class="prettyprint">
if (child[name] == biggestValue)
    biggestSpender += ' & ' + name;

else if (child[name] > biggestValue) {
    biggestSpender  = name;
    biggestValue    = child[name];
}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Alright, here's the meat of our loop and hopefully you can understand what it's doing just by looking at it. First we
                                are checking if the amount a child intends to spend is identical to our current largest recorded amount.
                                If they are equal, then the name of this child is appended to our biggestSpender string. If they are NOT equal,
                                then we check if the new value is larger than our previously recorded largest (remember biggestValue is set to 0 to start).
                                If it is larger, then we set biggestSpender to be the name of the current kid, and set biggestValue to be what
                                they plan to spend.
                            </p>
                            <p>The final thing we do is update our results area, but you should be familiar with that by now, so I'll skip
                            any explanation.</p>

                If / Else statements are an important constuct available in essentially all programming languages. You also got 
                your feet wet with loops in the For/In loop which is important for iterating over an object's properties.
